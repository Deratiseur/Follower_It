Follower_It

This mod lets you turn any companion (even those from mods) into a "follower" who doesn't count towards the group limit.
To turn a companion into a follower, simply make him drink a potion that can be purchased (unlimited stock):
In BG1EE from Bentley Mirrorshade in the Friendly Arm Inn.
In BG2/BG2EE from Hes, on the Waukyne promenade just outside the Irenicus dungeon.
In TOB from the keeper of the Tankard Tree in Saradush.

Note on followers:
- They have no banters, no dialog, no associated quests.
- They don't gain xp. To increase their xp (and equip them), proceed as follows: 
   * you must have activated the cheats
   * you must have a free place in the group
   * add the follower to the group by pointing to it and pressing Ctrl+Q
   * give the follower xp using the console (and equip him if necessary)
   * have him drink a potion to become a follower again.
- You can " talk " to followers to ask them to return to the group, but I don't recommend it: the Ctrl+q command works very well, whereas the return dialogue doesn't work very well with certain pnjs (some can't stand being excluded from the group).
- Using QTRL-Q and the potion, you can make the pjs follow/return as much as you like. You can trigger their quest if you know how.
- Very funny: you can even turn the main character into a follower. In this case, you automatically do game over if there's no one left in the main group.


What's the point of having people follow you out if they've got nothing more to say?
Well, let's take into account the pnjs who already don't have much to say:
Wilson (BG2EE), the heavyweight tank with nothing to lose because nothing to say.
Keldorn, with his super class and cool equipment, he loses a few banters and his mini quest.
Edwin and his +2 spells/level, he loses a few banters and his mini quest.
Viconia and her 65% MR, she loses a few banters, her mini quest, and her romance only if you play a woman.
1 day npc Horace and his +2 APR, he has almost nothing to say.
1 day npc Valen and her cheated level drain, she has almost nothing to say.
1 day npc Theal and his True vision and Mutant power, he has almost nothing to say.
1 day npc Malthis and his cheated equipment (including a sword that drains a level without save), he has almost nothing to say. ( Keep him for a while before making him drink the potion, his quest parts to make him evolve to the max flow together and take 10 minutes at most).
If you really don't care about dialogues: Yasraena and her 72% RM, +1 APR.
+ surely other (One day) npcs that are cheated ^^
